# Microsoft Foundry: Standard Agent Setup with Private APIM and E2E Network Isolation 

> **NEW**
> For support on deploying the right network isolation template, check out the [GitHub Copilot for Azure skill for private networking](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure/blob/main/plugin/skills/microsoft-foundry/resource/private-network/private-network.md) set-up!

---
## Overview
This infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution deploys a network-secured Azure AI agent environment with private networking, role-based access control (RBAC), and **private Azure API Management (APIM) integration**. This template extends the [standard agent setup (template 15)](../15-private-network-standard-agent-setup/) by adding support for connecting an **existing Azure API Management service** behind a private endpoint within your VNet. This allows you to expose APIs through APIM while keeping all traffic within your private network boundary.

Standard setup supports private network isolation through utilizing **Bring Your Own Virtual Network (BYO VNet)** approach, also known as **custom VNet support with subnet delegation.** 

This implementation gives you full control over the inbound and outbound communication paths for your agent. You can restrict access to only the resources explicitly required by your agent, such as storage accounts, databases, or APIs (via private APIM), while blocking all other traffic by default. This approach ensures that your agent operates within a tightly scoped network boundary, reducing the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access. By default, this setup simplifies security configuration while enforcing strong isolation guarantees, ensuring that each agent deployment remains secure, compliant, and aligned with enterprise networking policies. 

---

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when you need:
- **Full end-to-end network isolation** — All resources behind private endpoints with no public internet access
- **BYO VNet control** — You manage your own virtual network, subnets, and network security groups
- **Standard agent setup with BYO resources** — Customer-managed Storage, Cosmos DB, and AI Search for data residency and compliance
- **Private APIM integration** — Connect your existing Azure API Management service to the agent environment
- **System Assigned Managed Identity** — Simplified identity management with platform-managed credentials

### Template Decision Guide

Use the table below to choose the right infrastructure template for your scenario:

| Template | Agent Type | Networking | Identity | Key Use Case |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| [**15**](../15-private-network-standard-agent-setup/) | Standard (BYO resources) | BYO VNet + Private Endpoints | System Assigned MI | E2E network isolation with full agent capabilities |
| [**19**](../19-private-network-agent-tools/) | Standard (BYO resources) | BYO VNet + Private Endpoints | System Assigned MI | Same as 15 **plus** tools behind VNet (MCP, OpenAPI, Functions, A2A) |
| [**17**](../17-private-network-standard-user-assigned-identity-agent-setup/) | Standard (BYO resources) | BYO VNet + Private Endpoints | **User Assigned MI** | Same as 15 but with user-managed identity |
| [**16** (this template)](../16-private-network-standard-agent-apim-setup/) | Standard (BYO resources) | BYO VNet + Private Endpoints | System Assigned MI | Same as 15 **plus** private APIM integration |
| [**18**](../18-managed-virtual-network/) | Standard (BYO resources) | **Managed VNet** (Microsoft-managed) | System Assigned MI | Network isolation without managing your own VNet|
| [**15a**](../15a-private-network-evaluation-only-setup/) | Evaluation only | BYO VNet + Private Endpoints | System Assigned MI | Minimal setup for evaluation — no Cosmos DB, AI Search, or capability host |
| [**11**](../11-private-network-basic-vnet/) | **Basic** (platform-managed) | BYO VNet injection | System Assigned MI | Basic agents with VNet isolation — no BYO resources needed |
| [**41**](../41-standard-agent-setup/) | Standard (BYO resources) | **Public** (no VNet) | System Assigned MI | Standard agents without network isolation |
| [**40**](../40-basic-agent-setup/) | **Basic** (platform-managed) | **Public** (no VNet) | System Assigned MI | Simplest setup — no BYO resources, no private networking |

## Deploy to Azure

[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fazure-ai-foundry%2Ffoundry-samples%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Finfrastructure%2Finfrastructure-setup-bicep%2F16-private-network-standard-agent-apim-setup%2Fazuredeploy.json)

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions**
  - **Foundry Account Owner**: Needed to create the Microsoft Foundry account and project.
  - **Owner or Role Based Access Administrator**: Needed to assign RBAC on the Azure resources used by this template.
  - **Foundry User**: Needed to create and use agents, projects, or evaluation workloads after deployment.

1. **Register Resource Providers**

   Make sure you have an active Azure subscription that allows registering resource providers. For example, subnet delegation requires the Microsoft.App provider to be registered in your subscription. If it's not already registered, run the commands below:

   ```bash
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.KeyVault'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Search'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Network'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.App'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ContainerService'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ApiManagement'
   ```

1. Network administrator permissions (if operating in a restricted or enterprise environment)

1. Sufficient quota for all resources required by this template in the target Azure region, including model deployment quota.
    * If no parameters are passed in, this template creates an Microsoft Foundry resource, Foundry project, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure AI Search, and Azure Storage account. If an existing APIM resource ID is provided, a private endpoint is also created for APIM.
1. Azure CLI installed and configured on your local workstation or deployment pipeline server

---

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### Networking Requirements
1. Review network requirements and plan Virtual Network address space (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16 or an alternative non-overlapping address space)

2. Two subnets are needed as well:  
    - **Agent Subnet** (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24): Hosts Agent client for Agent workloads, delegated to Microsoft.App/environments. The recommended size should be /24 for this delegated subnet. 
    - **Private endpoint Subnet** (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24): Hosts private endpoints 
    - Ensure that the address spaces for these subnets do not overlap with any existing networks in your Azure environment or reserved IP ranges like the following: 169.254.0.0/16, 172.30.0.0/16, 172.31.0.0/16, 192.0.2.0/24, 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 100.100.0.0/17, 100.100.192.0/19, 100.100.224.0/19, 10.0.0.0/8.
  
  > **Notes:** 
  - If you do not provide an existing virtual network, the template will create a new virtual network with the default address spaces and subnets described above. If you use an existing virtual network, make sure it already contains two subnets (Agent and Private Endpoint) before deploying the template.
  - You must ensure the Foundry account was successfully created so that underlying caphost has also succeeded. Then proceed to deploying the project caphost bicep. 
  - You must ensure the subnet is exclusively delegated to __Microsoft.App/environments__ and cannot be used by any other Azure resources.
  

### Limitations / Known Issues

1. The delegated agent subnet must be exclusively used by a single Foundry account. It cannot be shared across accounts.
2. The Foundry resource and the virtual network must be in the same Azure region. BYO resources (Storage, Cosmos DB, AI Search) may be in different regions.
3. For the virtual network IP range, you may use any Private Class A, B or C IP range. Private Class A IP address ranges (10.x.x.x) are only supported in the following regions: **Australia East, Brazil South, Canada East, East US, East US 2, France Central, Germany West Central, Italy North, Japan East, South Africa North, South Central US, South India, Spain Central, Sweden Central, UAE North, UK South, West US, West US 3.** Use Class B (172.16.x.x) or C (192.168.x.x) ranges for other regions. You may not use any other IP range that overlaps to the list above or uses public IP ranges. 
4. This template does **not** support tools (MCP servers, OpenAPI tools, Azure Functions, A2A) behind the VNet. Use [template 19](../19-private-network-agent-tools/) for that scenario.
5. There is no upgrade path from BYO VNet (this template) to Managed Virtual Network (template 18). A Foundry resource redeployment is required.
6. All projects within the same Foundry account share model deployments. Per-project model isolation is not supported.
7. Cosmos DB is deployed as single-region. Multi-region replication must be configured manually post-deployment.

### Account Deletion Prerequisites and Cleanup Guidance

Before deleting an **Account** resource, it is essential to first delete the associated **Account Capability Host**. Failure to do so may result in residual dependencies—such as subnets and other provisioned resources (e.g., ACA applications)—remaining linked to the capability host. This can lead to errors such as **"Subnet already in use"** when attempting to reuse the same subnet in a different account deployment.

**Cleanup Options**

**1. Full Account Removal**: To completely remove an account, you must delete and purge the account. Simply deleting the account is not sufficient, you must purge so that deletion of the associated capability host is triggered. The service will automatically handle the removal of the capability host and any linked resources in the background. To purge the account, use the following [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/recover-purge-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource). Please allow approximately max of 20 minutes for all resources to be fully unlinked from the account.
 
**2. Retain Account, Remove Capability Host**: If you intend to retain the account but remove the capability host, execute the script `deleteCaphost.sh` located in this folder. After deletion, allow approximately max of 20 minutes for all resources to be fully unlinked from the account. To recreate the capability host for the account, use the script `createCaphost.sh` located in the same folder.


> **Important**: Before deleting the account capability host, ensure that the **project capability host** is deleted.



### Template Customization

Note: If not provided, the following resources will be created automatically for you:
- VNet and two subnets
- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL  
- Azure AI Search
- Azure Storage

**Private APIM Integration (Optional):** This template supports connecting an **existing Azure API Management service** behind a private endpoint. APIM is not created by this template — you must provide the ARM Resource ID of an existing APIM instance via the `apiManagementResourceId` parameter. When provided, a private endpoint and DNS zone for APIM (`privatelink.azure-api.net`) are created within your VNet.

#### BYO Resource Details

1. **Use Existing Virtual Network and Subnets**

To use an existing VNet and subnets, set the existingVnetResourceId parameter to the full Azure Resource ID of the target VNet and its address range, and provide the names of the two required subnets.  If the existing VNet is associated with private DNS zones, set the existingDnsZones parameter to the resource group name in which the zones are located. For example:
- param existingVnetResourceId = "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet-name>"
- param agentSubnetName string = 'agent-subnet' //optional, default is 'agent-subnet'
- param agentSubnetPrefix string = '192.168.0.0/24' //optional, default is '192.168.0.0/24'
- param peSubnetName string = 'pe-subnet' //optional, default is 'pe-subnet'
- param peSubnetPrefix string = '192.168.1.0/24' //optional, default is '192.168.1.0/24'
- param dnsZonesSubscriptionId string = '' //optional, leave empty to use current subscription, or set to a subscription ID if DNS zones are in a different subscription
- param existingDnsZones = {
       
         'privatelink.services.ai.azure.com': 'privzoneRG' //add resource group name where your private DNS zone is located
       
         'privatelink.openai.azure.com': '' //Leave empty to create new private dns zone... }

💡 If subnets information is provided then make sure it exist within the specified VNet to avoid deployment errors. If subnet information is not provided, the template will create subnets with the default address space.

💡 **Cross-Subscription DNS Zones**: All DNS zones specified in `existingDnsZones` will be referenced from the subscription specified in `dnsZonesSubscriptionId`. Leave this parameter empty (default) to use the current deployment subscription, or set it to a subscription ID if your DNS zones are located in a different subscription.

⚠️ **Important**: When `dnsZonesSubscriptionId` is set to a different subscription, ALL DNS zones in `existingDnsZones` must have resource groups specified (non-empty values). The template does not support creating new DNS zones in a different subscription. Empty resource groups are only allowed when creating zones in the current deployment subscription.


2. **Use an existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**

To use an existing Cosmos DB for NoSQL resource, set cosmosDBResourceId parameter to the full Azure Resource ID of the target Cosmos DB.
- param azureCosmosDBAccountResourceId string =  /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmosDbAccountName}

> **⚠️ Important: Cosmos DB Connection Requirements**
>
> When creating the Cosmos DB connection (e.g., via REST API or ARM), ensure the following:
> - The `authType` **must** be set to `AAD`. This is the only supported authentication type for the Cosmos DB connection used by the Agent Service.
> - The `metadata` section **must** include the `ResourceId` property, set to the full Azure Resource ID of your Cosmos DB account. The Agent Service relies on this property to correctly identify and connect to your Cosmos DB resource. Omitting `ResourceId` from the metadata will cause the connection to fail.
>
> Example connection properties:
> ```json
> {
>   "category": "CosmosDB",
>   "authType": "AAD",
>   "metadata": {
>     "ApiType": "Azure",
>     "ResourceId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmosDbAccountName}",
>     "location": "{region}"
>   }
> }
> ```


3. **Use an existing Azure AI Search resource**

To use an existing Azure AI Search resource, set aiSearchServiceResourceId parameter to the full Azure resource Id of the target Azure AI Search resource. 
 - param aiSearchResourceId string = /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/{searchServiceName}


4. **Use an existing Azure Storage account**

To use an existing Azure Storage account, set aiStorageAccountResourceId parameter to the full Azure resource Id of the target Azure Storage account resource. 
- param aiStorageAccountResourceId string = /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}

5. **Use an existing Azure API Management service**

To use an existing Azure API Management service, set apiManagementResourceId parameter to the full Azure resource Id of the target Azure API Management service.
- param apiManagementResourceId string = /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{apiManagementServiceName}

6. **Use an existing Application Insights resource for Foundry tracing**

To reuse an existing Application Insights resource instead of creating a new one, set `newOrExistingApplicationInsights` to `existing` and provide the full ARM resource ID:
- param newOrExistingApplicationInsights = 'existing'
- param applicationInsightsResourceId = /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/components/{applicationInsightsName}

When no existing resource ID is provided, the template creates a workspace-based Application Insights component and a Log Analytics workspace, then creates a Foundry account connection with:
- category: `AppInsights`
- auth type: `ApiKey`
- shared to all projects in the Foundry account
- target and metadata `ResourceId` set to the Application Insights resource ID

> **Note:** This tracing connection does not create Azure Monitor Private Link Scope or private ingestion/query endpoints. If your policy requires private Azure Monitor ingestion/query, add AMPLS and the required Azure Monitor private DNS zones as an additional networking module.

7. **Create a private Windows jumpbox for portal access**

Set `enableJumpbox` to `true` to create a Windows VM without a public IP and an Azure Bastion host for browser-based RDP access from the Azure portal.

For a new VNet, the template can derive jumpbox subnet prefixes from `vnetAddressPrefix`, or you can provide them explicitly:
- param enableJumpbox = true
- param bastionSubnetPrefix = '192.168.2.0/26'
- param jumpboxSubnetPrefix = '192.168.3.0/24'

For an existing VNet, provide explicit non-overlapping `bastionSubnetPrefix` and `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` values. Azure Bastion requires a subnet named exactly `AzureBastionSubnet`, and only one Bastion host is supported per VNet. Keep `enableJumpbox` set to `false` if the VNet already has Bastion.

> **Important:** Supply `jumpboxAdminPassword` securely at deployment time. Do not commit it to `main.bicepparam`, `azuredeploy.parameters.json`, or source control.

> **Networking note:** The jumpbox VM has no public IP. Azure Bastion uses a Standard public IP as the managed entry point. The VM still needs outbound HTTPS to reach `ai.azure.com`, Microsoft Entra sign-in, and Azure management endpoints. Private Foundry endpoints resolve privately only if VNet DNS is configured to resolve the linked private DNS zones.

## Deploy the bicep template

Choose your deployment method: Use the "Deploy to Azure" button from the provided README for an guided experience in Azure Portal

**Option 1: Automatic deployment** 
Click the deploy to Azure button above to open the Azure portal and deploy the template directly. 
- Fill in the parameters as needed, including the existing VNet and subnets if applicable. 


**Option 2: Manually deploy the bicep template**
- **Create a New (or Use Existing) Resource Group**

   ```bash
   az group create --name <new-rg-name> --location <your-rg-region>
   ```
- Deploy the main.bicep file
  - Edit the main.bicepparams file to use an existing Virtual Network & subnets, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage, Azure AI Search, and optionally an existing APIM resource.

   ```bash
      az deployment group create --resource-group <your-resource-group> --template-file main.bicep --parameters main.bicepparam
   ```

> **Note:** To access a private Foundry resource securely, use one of the following:
> - A VM or jump box on the virtual network, optionally accessed through Azure Bastion
> - Azure VPN Gateway
> - Azure ExpressRoute

### Cleanup

To delete all resources created by this template:

```bash
az group delete --name <your-resource-group> --yes --no-wait
```

> **Important**: If you need to reuse the same subnet, follow the [Account Deletion Prerequisites and Cleanup Guidance](#account-deletion-prerequisites-and-cleanup-guidance) to properly purge the account and wait for the capability host to fully unlink (~20 minutes).

### Core Components

**Microsoft Foundry** resource
- Central orchestration point
- Manages service connections
- Set networking and policy configurations

**Foundry** project
- Defines the workspace configuration 
- Service integration 
- Agents are created within a specific project, and each project acts as an isolated workspace. This means:
  - All agents in the same project share access to the same file storage, thread storage (conversation history), and search indexes.
  - Data is isolated between projects. Agents in one project cannot access resources from another. Projects are currently the unit of  sharing and isolation in Foundry. See the what is AI foundry article for more information on Foundry projects. 

**Bring Your Own (BYO) Azure Resources**: ensures all sensitive data remains under customer control. All agents created using our service are stateful, meaning they retain information across interactions. With this setup, agent states are automatically stored in customer-managed, single-tenant resources. The required Bring Your Own Resources include: 
- BYO File Storage: All files uploaded by developers (during agent configuration) or end-users (during interactions) are stored directly in the customer’s Azure Storage account.
- BYO Search: All vector stores created by the agent leverage the customer’s Azure AI Search resource.
- BYO Thread Storage: All customer messages and conversation history will be stored in the customer’s own Azure Cosmos DB account.

By bundling these BYO features (file storage, search, and thread storage), the standard setup guarantees that your deployment is secure by default. All data processed by Microsoft Foundry Agent Service is automatically stored at rest in your own Azure resources, helping you meet internal policies, compliance requirements, and enterprise security standards.

- Purpose: Open Foundry portal and validate private endpoint access from inside the VNet

### Network Security Design
This implementation utilizes a BYO VNet (Bring Your Own Virtual Network) approach, also known as custom VNet support with subnet delegation. Within your existing virtual network, one delegated subnet will be created.

Network Security
- Public network access disabled
- Private endpoints for all services
- Network ACLs with deny by default

**Network Infrastructure**
- A Virtual Network (192.168.0.0/16) is created (if existing isn't passed in)
- Agent Subnet (192.168.0.0/24): Hosts Agent client
- Private endpoint Subnet (192.168.1.0/24): Hosts private endpoints

**Private Endpoints** 
Private endpoints ensure secure, internal-only connectivity. Private endpoints are created for the following:
- Microsoft Foundry
- Azure AI Search
- Azure Storage
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure API Management (if provided)

Application Insights is connected for tracing but does not receive a private endpoint in this template. Private Azure Monitor ingestion/query requires Azure Monitor Private Link Scope and additional private DNS zones.

When `enableJumpbox` is true, the template also creates:
- `AzureBastionSubnet` for Azure Bastion
- A dedicated jumpbox subnet
- A jumpbox NSG allowing RDP only from `AzureBastionSubnet`

Do not attach a partial custom NSG to `AzureBastionSubnet`; Azure Bastion requires a specific rule set if that subnet is secured with an NSG.

**Private DNS Zones**
| Private Link Resource Type | Sub Resource | Private DNS Zone Name | Public DNS Zone Forwarders |
|----------------------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Microsoft Foundry**       | account      | `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com`<br>`privatelink.openai.azure.com`<br>`privatelink.services.ai.azure.com` | `cognitiveservices.azure.com`<br>`openai.azure.com`<br>`services.ai.azure.com` |
| **Azure AI Search**        | searchService| `privatelink.search.windows.net` | `search.windows.net` |
| **Azure Cosmos DB**        | Sql          | `privatelink.documents.azure.com` | `documents.azure.com` |
| **Azure Storage**          | blob         | `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` | `blob.core.windows.net` |
| **Azure API Management** (Optional) | Gateway     | `privatelink.azure-api.net` | `azure-api.net` |

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Managed Identity**
  - Zero-trust security model
  - No credential storage
  - Platform-managed rotation

  This template uses System Managed Identity, but User Assigned Managed Identity is also supported.

- **Role Assignments**
  - **Azure AI Search**
    - Search Index Data Contributor (`8ebe5a00-799e-43f5-93ac-243d3dce84a7`)
    - Search Service Contributor (`7ca78c08-252a-4471-8644-bb5ff32d4ba0`)
  - **Azure Storage Account**
    - Storage Blob Data Owner (`b7e6dc6d-f1e8-4753-8033-0f276bb0955b`)
    - Storage Queue Data Contributor (`974c5e8b-45b9-4653-ba55-5f855dd0fb88`) (if Azure Function tool enabled)
    - Two containers will automatically be provisioned during the project create capability host process:
      - Azure Blob Storage Container: `<workspaceId>-azureml-blobstore`
        - Storage Blob Data Contributor
      - Azure Blob Storage Container: `<workspaceId>-agents-blobstore`
        - Storage Blob Data Owner
  - **Cosmos DB for NoSQL**
    - Cosmos DB Operator (`230815da-be43-4aae-9cb4-875f7bd000aa`)
    - Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor
    - Three containers will automatically be provisioned during the create capability host process:
      - Cosmos DB for NoSQL container: `<${projectWorkspaceId}>-thread-message-store`
      - Cosmos DB for NoSQL container: `<${projectWorkspaceId}>-system-thread-message-store`
      - Cosmos DB for NoSQL container: `<${projectWorkspaceId}>-agent-entity-store`
