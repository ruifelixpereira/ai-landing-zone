    <em>A comprehensive solution accelerator for governing, observing, and accelerating AI deployments at scale with unified security, compliance, and intelligent orchestration.</em>
</div>

---

## 🚀 Overview

Citadel Governance Hub is an **enterprise-grade AI landing zone** that provides a centralized, governable, and observable control plane for AI consumption across teams and environments.

This repository is a **solution accelerator** that helps you deploy and operate the hub using:

- Infrastructure-as-code (Bicep)
- A unified AI gateway pattern (Azure API Management)
- Usage ingestion components (Logic Apps + Azure Functions)
- Validation notebooks and operational guides

## 🏛️ Part of the Foundry Citadel Platform

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This accelerator is the **reference implementation of Layer 1 – Governance Hub** in the [AI Citadel Platform](https://aka.ms/foundry-citadel) layered security architecture.

The **AI Citadel Platform** is a unified, layered approach to AI security and compliance, designed to enable enterprises to scale AI innovation while maintaining trust, security, and regulatory alignment. The platform is composed of four interlocking layers:

| Layer | Name | Responsibility | Implementation |
|-------|------|----------------|----------------|
| 🔷 **Layer 1** | **Governance Hub** | Runtime enforcement — unified AI gateway, policy-as-code, identity validation, token rate limiting, content filtering, cost attribution | **👉 This Accelerator** ([aka.ms/ai-hub-gateway](https://aka.ms/ai-hub-gateway)) |
| 🔶 **Layer 2** | **AI Control Plane** | Observability & compliance — agent traces, AI evaluations, fleet operations, automated compliance checks | [Microsoft Foundry Control Plane](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/control-plane/overview) |
| 🟢 **Layer 3** | **Agent Identity (Agent 365)** | Agent identity & lifecycle — unique agent identities, shadow agent detection, sponsorship model, access packages | [Governing Agent Identities with Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/agent-id-governance-overview) |
| 🛡️ **Layer 4** | **Security Fabric** | Unified protection — Microsoft Defender threat intelligence, Purview data governance, Entra access control | Microsoft Defender, Purview & Entra |

The layers are not isolated silos — they form an integrated architecture grounded in the principle of **separation of concerns with unified oversight**. Layer 1 (this accelerator) acts as the physical gateway through a hub-and-spoke deployment where a centrally managed AI gateway (Azure API Management) enforces runtime policies, while spoke environments give each business unit autonomous development within guardrails.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

AI Citadel Governance Hub follows a **hub-spoke architecture** that integrates seamlessly with your existing enterprise Azure Landing Zone:

![Citadel Governance Hub](./assets/citadel-governance-hub-v1.png)

### Networking approach

Detailed networking approach guidance for Citadel Governance Hub can be found in the [Network Approach Guide](./guides/network-approach.md).

Below is a high-level overview of the two supported deployment approaches:

#### Part of the hub network

In this approach, the Citadel Governance Hub is deployed within the existing hub virtual network (VNet) of your Azure Landing Zone.

This allows for direct communication between the unified AI gateway and connected agentic spokes, leveraging existing security and networking configurations.

#### Part of spoke network

In this approach, the Citadel Governance Hub is deployed within a dedicated spoke VNet that connects to the hub VNet via VNet peering. 

Agentic workloads in other spokes are routed first to the hub network firewall through direct peering, then forwarded to the Citadel Governance Hub gateway network.

This provides an additional layer of isolation for AI workloads while still enabling secure communication with other enterprise resources in the hub.

### 🎯 **Citadel Governance Hub** - Central Control Plane

The central governance layer with unified AI Gateway that all AI workloads route through.

### 🌐 **Citadel Compliant Agents** - Existing and new agents on-boarding

To govern AI agents through AI Citadel Governance Hub, agents must communicate with AI backends (central LLMs, tools and agents) through the Citadel's unified AI gateway.

#### Existing agents

Guidance to bring existing agents is through updating endpoint and credentials to access central LLMs, tools and agents through the **unified gateway**.

Recommendation is to use Azure Key Vault to store these information due to its sensitivity when the agent is running on Azure.

Leverage **Citadel Access Contracts** to declare the required access to LLMs, tools and agents through the gateway along with precise governance policies.

#### New agents

Building new agents is accelerated through the **Citadel Agent Environment** landing zone guidance, which provides isolated, secure environments designed specifically for AI agent development and deployment. Each spoke serves a single business unit or major use case, ensuring clear boundaries, simplified management, and integration with the Citadel Governance Hub for centralized governance.

For detailed guidance, see [AI App Landing Zone Repo](https://github.com/Azure/AI-Landing-Zones).

**Deployment Approach:**
- **One spoke per business unit or use case** - Dedicated environments for insurance claims processing, customer support automation, or other agentic scenarios
- **Flexible runtime options** - Choose between Microsoft Foundry Agents (fully managed runtime) or Azure Container Apps (bring-your-own-agent)
- **Pre-configured infrastructure** - Automated deployment via Bicep or Terraform with all networking, security, and monitoring built-in
- **Hub integration** - Seamless connection to Citadel Governance Hub through **Citadel Access Contracts**

**Deployment Patterns:**
- **Greenfield (Standalone with New Resources)** - Creates all infrastructure from scratch with new VNet and Log Analytics workspace
- **Brownfield (Standalone with Existing Resources)** - Integrates with existing enterprise landing zones, reusing VNets and centralized monitoring

> **Note:** Citadel Agent Environment deployment supports the AI development velocity pillar and is designed to work in conjunction with Citadel Governance Hub. Multiple environments can connect to a single hub for unified governance and observability.

## 🔄 AI Citadel Contracts - Connect agents to governance hub

Citadel Governance Hub seamlessly integrates with **Citadel compliant Agents** environments through automated governance alignment:

### 📝 **AI Access Contract**
Declares the governed dependencies an agent needs—LLMs, AI services, tools, and reusable agents—along with precise access policies:
- Model selection and capacity allocation
- Regional preferences and compliance requirements
- Safety and security guardrails (content safety, PII handling, OAuth scopes,...)
- Usage quotas and cost limits

### 📤 **AI Publish Contract**
Describes the tools and agents a spoke exposes back to the hub:
- Publishing rules and governance gates
- Ownership metadata and documentation
- Security posture and compliance status
- Discovery and cataloging in the AI Registry

>NOTE: Publish contracts are upcoming and will be available in future releases.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Audit-ready traceability through infrastructure-as-code
- ✅ Faster release cycles with automated approvals
- ✅ Reduced manual effort in governance onboarding
- ✅ Continuous policy compliance verification
